Another thing that I did was to keep it a linear scan while maintaining a map with the count of the characters in the window if k characters back. The more trivial approach would be to build a set of size k for each possible window.</description></item><item><title>Advent of Code 2022 - Day 01 to 05 Retrospective</title><link>https://brunobuss.dev/posts/advent-of-code-2022-retrospective-01-05/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brunobuss.dev/posts/advent-of-code-2022-retrospective-01-05/</guid><description>This is a small retrospective and some notes that I took while doing the Advent of Code 2022.
For this year I decided to use Go. Unlike last time where I went with Rust to learn the language (and had lots of fun doing it), I have used a bit of Go during my ~6 month rotation into GKE SRE while at Google. So even if I&amp;rsquo;m not totally new to the language, I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not used to write idiomatic Go anyway and I hope to improve this by the end of this year&amp;rsquo;s AoC :)</description></item><item><title>cat /dev/urandom > hello-world.md</title><link>https://brunobuss.dev/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brunobuss.dev/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>I think every good blog starts with a hello world, so this one couldn&amp;rsquo;t be different.
This will be a place where hopefully I can organise some thoughts that I want to share with all of you (whoever you might be!) and since sometimes I feel like my brain is a stream of random stuff, I thought this name was appropriate :)
I still have a couple of things to finish, but I decided to put this live in order to blog about this year&amp;rsquo;s Advent of Code.</description></item></channel></rss>
