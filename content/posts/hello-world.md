I think every good blog starts with a hello world, so this one couldn't be different.

This will be a place where hopefully I can organise some thoughts that I want to share with
all of you (whoever you might be!) and since sometimes I feel like my brain is a stream of
random stuff, I thought this name was appropriate :)

I still have a couple of things to finish, but I decided to put this live in order to blog about
this year's Advent of Code.

See you around! o/
