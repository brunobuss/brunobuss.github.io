Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman You know what I told about the books not being in a particular order? Forget that for this one, as this is for sure my top 1, without any doubts. This one struck a deep chord with me and I cannot help but recommend it to every single person that I can :p
From the title, you might feel like really associating it with Wait But Why&amp;rsquo;s Your Life in Weeks and from tag line, Time Management for Mortals, it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to reach the conclusion that this book is about personal productivity.</description></item></channel></rss>
